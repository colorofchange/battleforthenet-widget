			<p>Dear Chairman Wheeler:</p>
			<p>
				We are writing to urge you to implement strong and unambiguous
				net neutrality rules that protect the Internet from
				discrimination and other practices that will impede its ability to serve our
				democracy, empower consumers, and fuel economic growth.
				Erecting toll booths or designating	fast lanes on the
				information superhighway would stifle free speech, limit
				consumer choice, and thwart innovation.
			</p>
			<p>
				The FCC must act in a clear and decisive way to ensure the
				Internet does not become the bastion of powerful incumbents and
				carriers, but rather remains a place where all speakers,
				creators, and innovators can harness its power now and in the
				future. The Internet is a staple of our lives and our economy.
				The FCC should protect access to the Internet under a
				Title II framework, with appropriate forbearance,
				thereby ensuring greater regulatory and market certainty for
				users and broadband providers.
			</p>
			<p>
				To ensure that the Internet fulfills its promise of being a
				powerful, open platform for social, political, and economic
				life, the FCC must adopt a rule against blocking, a bright-line
				rule against application-specific discrimination, and a rule
				banning access fees. These principles of fairness and openness
				should not only apply to the so-call ed last-mile network, but
				also at points of interconnection to the broadband access
				provider's network. Likewise, strong net neutrality rules must
				apply regardless of whether users access the Internet on fixed
				or mobile connections.
			</p>
			<p>
				The FCC’s proposed rules would be a significant departure from
				how the Internet currently works, limiting the economic and
				expressive opportunity it provides. Investors, entrepreneurs,
				and employees have invested in businesses based on the
				certainty of a level playing field and equal-opportunity
				marketplace. The proposal would threaten those investments and
				undermine the necessary certainty that businesses and investors
				need going forward. The current proposed rules, albeit
				well-meaning, would be far-reaching. Erecting new barriers to 
				entry would result in fewer innovative startups, fewer
				micro-entrepreneurs, and fewer diverse voices in the public
				square. The FCC should abandon its current proposal and adopt
				a simple rule that reflects the essential values of our free
				markets, our participatory democracy, and our communications
				laws.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the history of the Internet is written, 2014 will be
				remembered as a defining moment. This FCC will be remembered
				either for handing the Internet over to the highest bidders or
				for ensuring that the conditions of Internet openness
				remain for the next generation of American entrepreneurs and
				citizens. We urge you to take bold and unequivocal action that
				will protect the open Internet and the opportunity it affords
				for innovation, economic development, communication, and
				democracy itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sincerely, 
			</p>
			<p>[/s]</p>
			<p>
				(Similar language is being circulated through the halls of
				Congress this week by Senator Angus King and others.)
			</p>

			<p>Most Americans have only one choice for truly high speed Internet: their local cable company. This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves competition and choice.</p>

			<p>Without net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able to manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down others. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.</p>

			<p>It also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and slow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field. When ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup attract investors?</p>

			<p>My friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for work and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are attacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won't stand for it.</p>

			<p>ISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again. Title II is the strong, legally sound way to enforce net neutrality. Use it.</p>
